This research website collects simulation studies on piece-wise exponential
models (PEM) and piece-wise exponential additive (mixed) models (PAMM).
A list of simulations available in this repository is given below:

- [PEM vs. PAM split point sensitivity](pem_vs_pam.html)

- [Confidence Intervals](confidence-intervals.html)
